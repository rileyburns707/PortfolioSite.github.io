# Portfolio Website

During my job search I learned a physical paper resume is needed, but there is more potential for personalization by creating a website. I did not know how to code in HTML but I knew I could learn. I spent time creating my portfolio and updating my github repositories to create this! Feel free to reach out to me using the "Contact Me" section at the bottom of the website!
